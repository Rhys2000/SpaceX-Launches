The integrated space team also includes several other key subcontractors and industry leaders with unparalleled experience in both the design and construction of complex communications systems and satellites.

MicroSat Systems (MSI), a wholly owned subsidiary of SNC, will leverage its experience on the TacSat-2 mission to design the spacecraft and perform integration and test activities for the OG2 satellites.", "In June 2008 SNC selected Argon ST to develop and deliver the satellite payloads for the ORBCOMM Generation 2 (OG2) satellite constellation. Each OG2 satellite will be equipped with an enhanced communications payload designed to increase subscriber capacity by up to 12 times over the current Orbcomm satellites. Orbcomm customers will be able to transmit data over the OG2 satellites at greater speeds and send larger data packets using future modems. The OG2 satellites will be backward compatible so that existing subscriber communicators will function seamlessly with the OG2 satellites. In addition, all OG2 satellites will be designed with Automatic Identification System (AIS) payloads to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped maritime vessels. Orbcomm intends to market this AIS data to U.S. and international coast guards and government agencies, as well as companies engaged in security or logistics businesses for tracking shipping activities or for other navigational purposes.", "The total contract value for the 18 spacecraft is $117 million.

When proven, future operational missions will provide a large-scale data transfer service to remote commercial, civil and military clients anywhere in the world. Similar to the operations of a traditional courier company, Cascade will pick-up a parcel at close of business day, and deliver it to geographically dispersed destinations before work starts the next day. The difference is that the service will utilize a small satellite and the packages will be very large digital data files. Initially, one Low Earth Orbit satellite will orbit above the Earth at an altitude of 300 to 1,500 km once every 1.5 hours, providing multiple opportunities each day for the pick-up and delivery of data anywhere on Earth. As demand increases, capacity can be expanded by adding additional satellites. Cascade is accessed through small turnkey terminals with built-in mass storage capacity and 1-2 meter antennas. The terminal communicates with the Cascade control centre to schedule pickup and confirm delivery. As the satellite comes overhead, the data is transmitted at 1.2 gigabits per second - 12 times faster than the operating speed of most office LANs. At that speed, the contents of a typical music CD would be transferred in a little over 4 seconds and a full length DVD movie in little more than a minute.

Calcium is important to overall plant growth and development, but it also plays a role in the process of sensing gravity and signaling the response of downward plant growth. To better understand the role of the on/off modulation of cellular calcium ion channels in gravity sensing, the SporeSat experiment will measure the effect of different artificial gravity levels on calcium concentrations that result from the opening and closing of these channels. Specifically, the SporeSat experiment will utilize three lab-on-a-chip devices, called bioCDs, that integrate the sensors that allow for real-time measurement of calcium signaling at each of the variable gravity treatments planned for the experiment.

The integrated space team also includes several other key subcontractors and industry leaders with unparalleled experience in both the design and construction of complex communications systems and satellites. SNC, Boeing and ITT will provide oversight, systems engineering, technical management, integration and mission assurance functions to assure the successful performance of the OG2 program. MicroSat Systems (MSI), a wholly owned subsidiary of SNC, will leverage its experience on the TacSat-2 mission to design the spacecraft and perform integration and test activities for the OG2 satellites.", "In June 2008 SNC selected Argon ST to develop and deliver the satellite payloads for the ORBCOMM Generation 2 (OG2) satellite constellation. Each OG2 satellite will be equipped with an enhanced communications payload designed to increase subscriber capacity by up to 12 times over the current Orbcomm satellites. Orbcomm customers will be able to transmit data over the OG2 satellites at greater speeds and send larger data packets using future modems. The OG2 satellites will be backward compatible so that existing subscriber communicators will function seamlessly with the OG2 satellites.

As a result of the expanded scope of the project, the total cost of Iridium NEXT, including all costs associated with development, manufacture and launch of the constellation, is now anticipated to be approximately $2.9 billion.
