Each OG2 satellite will be equipped with an enhanced communications payload designed to increase subscriber capacity by up to 12 times over the current Orbcomm satellites. Orbcomm customers will be able to transmit data over the OG2 satellites at greater speeds and send larger data packets using future modems. The OG2 satellites will be backward compatible so that existing subscriber communicators will function seamlessly with the OG2 satellites. In addition, all OG2 satellites will be designed with Automatic Identification System (AIS) payloads to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped maritime vessels.

When proven, future operational missions will provide a large-scale data transfer service to remote commercial, civil and military clients anywhere in the world. Similar to the operations of a traditional courier company, Cascade will pick-up a parcel at close of business day, and deliver it to geographically dispersed destinations before work starts the next day. The difference is that the service will utilize a small satellite and the packages will be very large digital data files. Initially, one Low Earth Orbit satellite will orbit above the Earth at an altitude of 300 to 1,500 km once every 1.5 hours, providing multiple opportunities each day for the pick-up and delivery of data anywhere on Earth. As demand increases, capacity can be expanded by adding additional satellites. Cascade is accessed through small turnkey terminals with built-in mass storage capacity and 1-2 meter antennas. The terminal communicates with the Cascade control centre to schedule pickup and confirm delivery. As the satellite comes overhead, the data is transmitted at 1.2 gigabits per second - 12 times faster than the operating speed of most office LANs. At that speed, the contents of a typical music CD would be transferred in a little over 4 seconds and a full length DVD movie in little more than a minute.

The integrated space team also includes several other key subcontractors and industry leaders with unparalleled experience in both the design and construction of complex communications systems and satellites. SNC, Boeing and ITT will provide oversight, systems engineering, technical management, integration and mission assurance functions to assure the successful performance of the OG2 program. MicroSat Systems (MSI), a wholly owned subsidiary of SNC, will leverage its experience on the TacSat-2 mission to design the spacecraft and perform integration and test activities for the OG2 satellites.", "In June 2008 SNC selected Argon ST to develop and deliver the satellite payloads for the ORBCOMM Generation 2 (OG2) satellite constellation. Each OG2 satellite will be equipped with an enhanced communications payload designed to increase subscriber capacity by up to 12 times over the current Orbcomm satellites. Orbcomm customers will be able to transmit data over the OG2 satellites at greater speeds and send larger data packets using future modems. The OG2 satellites will be backward compatible so that existing subscriber communicators will function seamlessly with the OG2 satellites.

In addition an unpressurized trunk is included, which provides for the stowage of unpressurized cargo and will support Dragon's solar arrays and thermal radiators.", "SpaceX was one of two winners of the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition.

IKUNS will involve developing a cubesat for Earth Observation and technological testing.", "The aim of 1KUNS-PF is testing in orbit and prove functionality of several components, either commercial or developed in house, intended for use in the IKUNS mission. In detail, the in-house developed systems are: Silicon cell solar panel, Telemetry Electronic Board, 3-DOF attitude control system, using a momentum wheel", "The mission profile includes two basic nominal operation phases. In the first, data about the experimental on-board system performance are gathered by transmitting to ground the system telemetry data. This phase is mainly devoted to assessing the performance in orbit of the in-house developed solar panel. After deployment, the CubeSat turns on and starts transmitting a Beacon signal, containing telemetry data taken once per minute. This beacon transmission is useful for first acquisition by the ground station. At the same time a de-tumbling procedure is activated, in which the satellite residual motion is damped out. When this nominal configuration is achieved and reliable communication to ground have been established, the CubeSat starts its nominal mode based on a passive magnetic attitude stabilization: beacon is stopped with a specific command and the satellite is in stand-by mode, waiting for commands. Telemetry is stored on-board and downloaded to ground upon command to verify the health-status and performance. If all these operations are well executed it’s possible to consider the minimum mission goal is achieved. The second nominal operation mode, activated by specific command from ground, is devoted to taking a picture and sending it to ground and momentum wheel testing. If these two activities are correctly executed, the mission is considered completely successful.", "1KUNS-PF has been selected by the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) to benefit from the opportunity to be launched by the Japanese Kibo module in the International Space Station (ISS), as part of the KiboCUBE program."],

The results of the experiment will inform future development of advanced instrumentation by Aurora and component development by SpaceQuest. SpaceQuest will also test the effectiveness of a new VHF “backdoor” receiver that the company designed and built to receive executive commands and/or to reboot the satellite flight computer in the event of a system failure. SpaceQuest will test whether the receiver, with its low-cost design and reduced weight and power, has the ability to function in very small satellites. The technical challenge is to demonstrate in space that a small, low-power radio device can be used to command a spacecraft independent of its traditional TT&C radio equipment.

If successful, this would bring a cost-effective data communication technology to a new class of users – those with operations that require direct-to-orbit access to small amounts of data from numerous low-power devices.", "The primary objective of the mission is to evaluate the Myriota communications waveforms and firmware on board the experimental payload. It is to investigate, identify and resolve potential technical and implementation issues with its advanced satellite SDR radio design. Another important objective is to demonstrate the ability to upload and run new firmware that can introduce new features to the SDR Radio after it is on orbit. The results of this three-phase experiment will demonstrate and validate the ability to uplink large numbers of messages to a satellite using a single channel, demonstrate the ability to downlink messages to different ground devices on a single channel, and implement Myriota’s advanced signal processing algorithms on board a satellite to provide highly spectrally efficient bidirectional communications.", "The satellite carried also an AIS (Automatic Identification System) receiver to gather position data from ships.", "The satellite was launched on Spaceflight Industry's SSO-A multi-satellite launch on a Falcon-9 v1.2 (Block 5) rocket."],

The Air Force decided in 2011 to stabilize the GPS-3 production line before introducing upgrades to the system. The decision to not to upgrade GPS-3 according to a block schedule will remove constraints and allow for adding on the technology when the threat calls for doing so. In addition, the complexity of position, navigation and timing technology has evolved since the Air Force awarded the GPS-3 prime contract in 2008. Anti-jam capabilities are planned to be added to the system beginning with the ninth satellite.", "Also carried as a secondary payload are nuclear detonation detection sensors (NDS).", "The first two satellites were ordered in 2008.

This includes NASA's SET-1 experiments. SET-1 consists of the Cosmic Radiation Environment Dosimetry and Charging Experiment (CREDANCE), the Dosimetry Intercomparison and Miniaturization Experiment (DIME), the Development of Space-Based Test Platform for the Characterization of Proton Effects and Enhanced Low Dose Rate Sensitivity (ELDRS) in Bipolar Junction Transistors and the COTS-2 Digital Technologies.", "MicroSat Systems, Inc. was awarded a $9,385,245 cost-plus award-fee contract to build the Deployable Structures Experiment (DSX) Host Spacecraft Bus (HSB) for the Air Force Research Laboratory, Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M.

The “shirt sleeve” operational environment GPIM offers will change ground processing time from weeks to days. Building and operating satellites will become easier and simplified. NASA and Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. of Boulder, Colo., are collaborating on the Green Propellant Infusion Mission, which seeks to improve overall propellant efficiency while reducing the toxic handling concerns associated with the highly toxic fuel, hydrazine. The space technology infusion mission also strives to optimize performance in new hardware, system and power solutions while ensuring the best value for investment and the safest space missions possible.", "The GPIM project will demonstrate the practical capabilities of a Hydroxyl Ammonium Nitrate fuel/oxidizer blend, known as “AF-M315E.” This innovative, low-toxicity propellant, developed by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., is a high-performance, green alternative to hydrazine.NASA and its partners always strive to maintain the strictest safety standards for storage, transport and use of rocket propellants. While all rocket fuels can be dangerous to handle without the proper safety precautions, AF-M315E has significantly reduced toxicity levels compared to hydrazine, making it easier and safer to store and handle. It also requires fewer handling restrictions and potentially shorter launch processing times, resulting in lowered costs.", "AF-M315E also is expected to improve overall vehicle performance. It boasts a higher density than hydrazine, meaning more of it can be stored in containers of the same volume. In addition, it delivers a higher specific impulse, or thrust delivered per given quantity of fuel, and has a lower freezing point, requiring less spacecraft power to maintain its temperature.The GPIM payload will fly to space aboard a Ball BCP-100 compact small satellite. During the test flight, researchers will conduct orbital maneuvers to demonstrate the performance of the propellant during attitude control shifts, changes in orbital inclination and orbit lowering.", "Once proven in flight, the project will present AF-M315E -- and compatible tanks, valves and thrusters -- to NASA and the commercial spaceflight industry as a viable, effective solution for future green propellant-based mission applications. The project is spearheaded by Ball Aerospace, home to the program’s principal investigator, and includes co-investigators at Aerojet Corp. in Redmond, Wash.; NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland; and the Air Force Research Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base.

During GPIM’s planned 81-day flight, the thrusters will be fired to simulate a spacecraft’s typical modes of operation in orbit and during re-entry into the atmosphere.", "Additionaly a set of experimental Defense Department scientific payloads are flown on GPIM under a $3.4 million payload integration contract. The DoD Space Experiments Review Board selected the Integrated Miniaturized Electrostatic Analyzer Reflight (iMESA-R), Small Wind and Temperature Spectrometer (SWATS) and Space Object Self-tracker (SOS) payloads to be part of the GPIM technology demonstration mission.", "The demonstration mission will last approximately two months.

Three of these panels are covered in solar cells. The fourth is covered in Duraflect material. Duraflect is a highly reflective, diffuse white coating used as an optical standard for characterization and calibration measurements. Under and on the back of each deployable panel are specific materials requested by telescope operators for their distinct spectral characteristics. These materials are red, blue, yellow, and clear anodized aluminum. Each panel is deployed separately through the actuation of Frangibolt actuators. Spring-loaded hinges then lift the panel until it locks in place 90° from its undeployed position. These deployable panels allow the spectral signature of Oculus-ASR to be changed multiple times over the course of the mission by altering the vehicle’s shape and exposed materials. Two releasable objects are mounted to the Oculus module. These objects are approximately 10 cm in diameter and will be used to provide ground observers an opportunity to view small, closely spaced objects. The releasable objects are coated in the same Duraflect material used on the deployable panel, and can be released individually using the same style of Frangibolt actuator used for the deployable panels. These objects then drift from the vehicle due to the force exerted from the actuator.", "The Oculus-ASR will perform coordinated maneuvers during overflights of the Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS), which is an array of mountain-top telescopes used to inspect orbiting objects. AMOS investigators will attempt to determine the orientation and shape of the vehicle and will compare these measurements with the actual \"truth\" data that is downloaded from the satellite. The vehicle has the capability to change its shape by deploying panels to exercise the AMOS algorithms and see if ground observers can detect the shape changes. The Oculus-ASR also carries two sensitive imaging cameras that were donated by SAIC and Raytheon Missile Systems.
